# Java classes for the Lunatic Model

Java classes for the Lunatic questionnaire model.

This library offers serialization and deserialization for Lunatic json questionnaires.

## Implementation

The model is described by the Java classes. [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) is used for 
serialization/deserialization.

## The Lunatic Model

Note that this project does not define the Lunatic model (although its name suggests it): 
[Lunatic](https://github.com/InseeFr/) does (changes in the questionnaire model in Lunatic are brought in 
Lunatic-Model in a second stage).

In Lunatic, classes are defined in the 
[type source typescript file](https://github.com/InseeFr/Lunatic/blob/3.0/src/type.source.ts).

## Documentation

Documentation can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/InseeFr/Lunatic-Model/tree/master/docs) folder and browsed [online](https://inseefr.github.io/Lunatic-Model). (Needs to be updated.)
